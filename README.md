## Overview
This course is a successor to the prerequisite CS 106A. It covers advanced programming topics such as recursion, algorithmic analysis, and data abstraction using the C++ language. CS 106B assumes that you already have significant prior programming experience and already know the material of CS 106A, and that you can use this understanding as a foundation on which to tackle new topics in programming and data abstraction.
