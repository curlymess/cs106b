Everybody round me saying I should relax cause
I've been going hard till my eyes roll back but
All I wanna do is forget about my past and
Smoke a little , really nothing too drastic
Any time you see me in a picture and I'm smiling
Probably cause I'm faded or I'm chilling with the fans and
Not really the type to let a talk back but
Imma let it slide cause my too violent
Shoutout to the ones who spend money like a habit
Even if they had a million dollars, they'd be trapping
Got a couple girls shooting movies on the mattress
Then I hit the booth, make the soundtrack
Then I play it back on the eighty-inch plasma
Then I get em faded off that super fantastic
Roll that grandmaster, smell it through the plastic
Nobody can handle me, I'm gone when the too strong

[Hook – The Weeknd]
The night's too long
I took too much and I've gone too far
And I might not make it
I might not make it
This time I might not make it
I might not make it
I might not make it
This time I might not make it
I might not make it
I might not make it
This time I might not make it
I might not

[Verse 2 – Belly]
Know, told a girl, It's different strokes for different folks
Came up out the north, we was playing with a different snow
Took my brothers from the four-one to pacific coast
We no longer put no fish scale on the fishing boat
Listen close, I know all you b want is liquor, smoke
Liquor, smoke
I know all you want is and dough…and dough
Told her, you don't gotta make it difficult
Baby, sit calm, we don't need another episode
Hippy sending me pictures
She told me no religion was the new religion
She said she don't believe in God but her shoes Christian
I heard she serving everybody like the soup kitchen
Getting girls higher, getting girls higher
She got work in the morning, I'm getting girls fired
Why you always call it purp when you mix it pink?
You know I mix the drinks when the too strong

[Hook – The Weeknd]
The night's too long
I took too much and I've gone too far
And I might not make it
I might not make it
This time I might not make it
I might not make it
I might not make it
This time I might not make it
I might not make it
I might not make it
This time I might not make it
I might not
